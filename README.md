## Welcome

Thanks for checking out this backend project.

[Mastering Backend](https://masteringbackend.com) projects help you improve your coding skills by building real-world backend applications with:

- Pre-built frontend integrations
- Database files
- Detailed PRDs (Project Requirement Documents)

**Prerequisite:** You should have a solid understanding of at least one backend programming language (PHP, Node.js, Python, Rust, C#, Java, Go, etc.).

---

## Project Overview

Your task is to build the backend API for this project and connect it to the provided frontend (already integrated to work with the API).

- [View the project details](https://app.masteringbackend.com/projects)  
- Use any tools or frameworks you like  
- Follow the PRD for features, requirements, and API structure

---

## Objectives (General)

Depending on the PRD, you may need to:

- Implement authentication (sign up, log in, account management)
- Provide CRUD endpoints for core entities
- Enable searching, filtering, and pagination
- Manage related resources (users, content, files, media, etc.)
- Implement role-based access control
- Handle file uploads or media streaming
- Return clean, consistent API responses
- Follow best practices for security, performance, and documentation

## Project Files and Resources

- **Database** → `db.sqlite` file in the root folder
- **Frontend** → Available on the project page under "Preview Frontend"
- **Design (Optional)** → Figma file available for PRO members
- **PRD Document** → `prd.pdf` in the root folder with:
  - Features
  - API structure
  - Use cases
  - Objectives
- **Assets** → Images/files optimized for correct screen sizes

## Suggested Workflow

1. Create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) to share and get feedback.
2. Review the PRD thoroughly before coding.
3. Plan architecture:
   - Choose backend language and framework
   - Design database schema
4. Build incrementally:
   - Start with authentication
   - Implement core features step-by-step
5. Test with the provided frontend before deployment.
